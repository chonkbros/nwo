This repo holds a data processing workflow that pulls data from a google drive folder and then converts the zst file into a JSONL file. Afterwards, that jsonL file is unnested, breaking characters are removed, and checked against a schema (optional). When that data is processed it is then uploaded to a mongoDB collection.
